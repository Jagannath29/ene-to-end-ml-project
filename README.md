# End-To-End Machine Learning Project

### First I created a "setup.py" file to keep all of my work inside it.

## setup.py
- Responsible for creating my ML application as a package. 
- With the help of setup.py, i will be able to create my entire ML app as a package, from there anybody can install it and use it.

### Also created requirements.txt file to install all of the required libraries for this project
