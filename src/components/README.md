## Components

- Components are like all the module that we are going to create like initally we create process called data ingestion.
- Components can be created as package and it can also exported like it can be imported to some other file location.

## Data Ingestion
- It simply means reading a data set from a database or it can be from some other file location. 
- I will divide the entire dataset into train and test. And also perform cross validation.

### After injecting the data I will transform, for that i will create data_transform file.
- We will perform here task like converting categorical features into numerical features, handle one_hot_coding, handle label_encoding etc.

### After transformation I cile create model_trainer file to train my model.
- I will use different types of algorithm in here.


## Pipeline
